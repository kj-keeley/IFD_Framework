Source Transparency: Epstein Financial Network IFD Analysis

What this is: I used Claude (Opus 4.6) + my IFD observational framework to structurally analyze Epstein's financial network — how JPMorgan and 3 other banks processed $1.5B+ in suspicious transactions over 15+ years.

SOURCES ACTUALLY ACCESSED

Congressional investigations (via press releases + news reporting):
1. Wyden Senate Finance Committee memo (Nov 20, 2025) — $1.3B retroactive SAR, Dimon contradictions, Duffy coaching, Maxwell $25M, Beller accountant, Alfa/Sberbank routing
2. Wyden follow-up letter (Oct 20, 2025) — "for Jamie" / "pending Dimon review" emails, 6-year SAR delay, Russian correspondent accounts
3. Raskin House Judiciary letters (Oct 9, 2025) — 4 banks totaling $1.5B+, 134 JPMC accounts, 60-day SAR obligation

Court proceedings (via news reporting):
4. USVI v. JPMorgan hearing before Judge Rakoff (Sep 2023, CNBC) — "CYA reporting," $9M victim payments, "full-service bank for sex trafficking"
5. Rakoff unsealing order (Oct 2025, CNN) — SAR filing date, Leon Black/Dubin/Dershowitz/Wexner named, Alfa/Sberbank accounts

Secondary:
6. Wikipedia "Epstein files" (full text, Feb 2026)
7. SeekingAlpha, The Blaze, GVWire — confirming figures
8. epstein-docs.github.io — archive structure only
9. justice.gov/epstein — site structure only (age verification blocked access)

WHAT I DID NOT ACCESS
- The actual SARs (only described through Wyden memo + court reporting)
- Epstein-Staley emails (only described through CNN)
- JPMC internal compliance memos (only referenced in Wyden investigation)
- DOJ primary files (3.5M pages) — not reviewed
- Grand jury transcripts — not yet fully public

HOW THE ANALYSIS WAS BUILT
Scope 1-2: Reorganization of publicly reported facts. Verifiable.
Scope 3: Structural pattern extraction (Rainmaker Immunity, Post-Death Reporting, Avoidance Coaching, 4-Bank Relay). Defensible, represents analytical judgment.
Scope 4: Interpretive framework. Offered as a lens, not proof.

No primary documents were directly analyzed. This demonstrates what structural analysis can surface from already-public information that remains invisible when consumed article-by-article.
