# IFD Observation Scopes & Lenses

An observation framework within Information Fluid Dynamics (IFD).

## Overview

A system using 4 Scopes (observation ranges) and their associated Lenses (observation axes) to analyze information and situations from multiple perspectives.

## 4 Scopes

| Scope | Definition | Scale |
|-------|------------|-------|
| **Scope 1: Data** | Smallest unit of information, without time axis | Minimum |
| **Scope 2: State** | Position and energy on the time axis | Small–Medium |
| **Scope 3: Causality** | Patterns and relationships | Medium–Large |
| **Scope 4: Flow** | Fractals, principles, trajectories | Maximum |

## Lenses (Observation Axes per Scope)

### Scope 1: Data
| Lens | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Reliability** | How trustworthy is the source of the data |

### Scope 2: State
| Lens | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Tension** | Current pressure or stress level |
| **Potential** | Direction and possibilities of energy |
| **Delta** | Comparison with the past, change |

### Scope 3: Causality
| Lens | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Pattern** | Recurring structures |
| **A→B** | Direction of cause and effect |
| **Actionability** | Whether intervention or action is possible |

### Scope 4: Flow
| Lens | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Fractal** | Shapes that repeat at different scales |
| **Principle** | Underlying rules that govern the whole |
| **Trajectory** | Direction or path being followed |
| **Tendency** | Inclination, force as a field |

## Usage

### Default: 2-Scope Hierarchical Method

1. Select two scopes
2. Observe the smaller scope first (foundation)
3. Layer the larger scope on top (hierarchy)

Example:
- **Scope 2 → Scope 4** (State → Flow)
  - First, observe current Tension/Potential
  - Then, based on that, observe larger Patterns and Trajectory

### Combination Characteristics

| Combination | Characteristics | Best For |
|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| 1→2 (Data→State) | Precise, present-focused | Real-time analysis |
| 1→3 (Data→Causality) | Structural, objective | Logical analysis |
| 1→4 (Data→Flow) | Points and totality | Extracting essence |
| 2→3 (State→Causality) | Dynamic, practical | Daily conversation, decision-making |
| 2→4 (State→Flow) | Intuitive, panoramic | Confirming direction |
| 3→4 (Causality→Flow) | Structure and principles | Long-term strategy, theory building |

## Design Principles

- **Experience first, language second**: Use it, then name it
- **No unusable Lenses**: If it can't be measured, put it on hold
- **Abstract axes for abstract scopes**: Maintain scale consistency
- **Don't wait for perfection**: Correct while moving
